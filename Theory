Pooling is the layer added to the CNN just after the convolution layer.
Problem with convolution operation:-
1)Memory issue
2)Translation Variance

We can reduce the size of feature map by increasing the value of stride.but we use pooling more than stride.bcz pooling solves the problem of translational variance.

Translation Variance:-
Convolutional operation follows the translation variance.The function of convolutional operation is to seek features in the image.But when we apply convolutional operation
then the features we identify become location dependent.But when we are doing image classification,then location should not worry us,the feature is more imp. but if our 
features become location dependent,then in the further layers,they will be treated differently,like the ear of a cat in top left of the image will be considered 
differengt from the image of the cat in top right.The problem with convolution operation is that the feature which we are detecting,location is tied up with them.
We want translation invariance.
This is given by pooling.It is a way to down sample the feature map.

First we apply some non linearity over the feature map-so we apply relu over it.We apply pooling over non-linear feature map.

If you have got multiple feature maps then we do pooling over individual feature map.
